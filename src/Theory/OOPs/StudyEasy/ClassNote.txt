1. What does OOPs is so favours?
= We can depict the real life scenario using programming using object-oriented programming.
e.g. - Keyboard, Monitor,
- Object has properties and
- Objects has functionalities.

In other words we can also say that:
Object has states and
Object has behavior

2. Properties of a Class
We usually make the properties of a class private and the behaviors of the class is use to
access the properties.

In Car i.e. door, engine, driver, speed are the properties.

-----------------------------------------------------------
public class Car {
    private String doors;
    private String engine;
    private String driver;
    private int speed;
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

3. What is getters and setters?
=> The return type for the setters would be `void`.
Because, we are setting some information.

-----------------------------------------------------------
package Theory.OOPs.StudyEasy;

public class Car {
    private String doors;
    private String engine;
    private String driver;
    private int speed;

    // Setters:
    public void setSpeed(int speed){
        this.speed = speed;
    }

    // Getters:
    public int getSpeed(){
        return speed;
    }
}
